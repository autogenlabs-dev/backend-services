# Decision Log

## 2025-07-27: Initial Project Setup and Memory Bank Initialization

- **Context:** The project required cleaning and the establishment of a system for maintaining context.
- **Decision:** Removed all existing documentation and test files to start with a clean slate. Initialized a Memory Bank to systematically log project information.
- **Rationale:** A clean slate ensures that all future work is based on the current understanding of the project. The Memory Bank provides a structured way to maintain context, track progress, and log key decisions.
- **Implications:** All previous documentation and test history has been removed. All future project context will be stored and managed within the Memory Bank.
